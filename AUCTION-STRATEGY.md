# IPL Fantasy Pro - Auction Strategy Guide

## Understanding Player Value

### Value = Points / Price

The fundamental principle:
```
Value = Expected Points ÷ Price

Higher value = More points per crore spent
```

### Value Tiers

| Tier | Value Ratio | Strategy |
|------|-------------|----------|
| ELITE | 15+ pts/L | Must-have anchors |
| SOLID | 10-15 pts/L | Reliable starters |
| VALUE | 7-10 pts/L | Good bargains |
| SPECULATIVE | 5-7 pts/L | High risk, high reward |
| LOTTO | <5 pts/L | Cheap bench players |

## Building Your Squad

### The 5-4-2 Rule (Budget ₹50L)

Recommended budget allocation:
- **5 Crore:** Core batsmen (anchor your batting)
- **4 Crore:** Core bowlers (guaranteed wickets)
- **2 Crore:** All-rounders (versatility)
- **2 Crore:** Wicket-keeper (safe pick)
- **Rest:** Bench + overseas + backups

### Team Composition

```
Ideal Squad (15 players):
├── 4 Batsmen (₹20L)
├── 3 Bowlers (₹12L)  
├── 4 All-rounders (₹10L)
├── 2 WK (₹4L)
└── 2 Overseas (₹4L)
```
