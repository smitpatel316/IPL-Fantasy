# 2026-02-20 - Design Research & Native Development

## UI/UX Research Completed

**Saved to design agent memory:**
- Airbnb UX case studies (2 articles)
- Figma 7 UI design principles
- Airbnb Swift Style Guide
- Competitor analysis (Yahoo Fantasy benchmark)

## Key Takeaways

### From Airbnb Case Studies:
- Design-led leadership matters
- Iterative design > big bang
- Progressive disclosure - don't overwhelm
- User research before solutions
- 3D & animations for modern feel

### From Figma Principles:
1. Hierarchy - guide attention
2. Progressive disclosure - show only what's needed
3. Consistency - same patterns
4. Contrast - draw attention
5. Accessibility - WCAG AA minimum
6. Proximity - related items together
7. Alignment - grid systems

## Native vs React Native

**Decision: Swift/SwiftUI for MVP**

Rationale:
- User wants "top notch UI" = native performance
- Yahoo Fantasy benchmark = smooth, bug-free, amazing animations
- Airbnb moved back to native for performance
- SwiftUI is declarative like React, easier transition

## Next Steps

1. Update design agent with research
2. Consider creating native iOS developer agent
3. Begin implementation with SwiftUI

## Notes

User wants autonomous operation - continue researching and improving without waiting.
